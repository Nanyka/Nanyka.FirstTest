    <p>Before taking a tour around Porvoo, you should fill up your energy in Salt restaurant, just across from the church here in town. We highly recommend its soup for only $2. So you will felt fine about it budget but it really good. They do sort of a family-style, sort of tapas, a little bit of everything. So yummy. The carrots and the falafel so good. </p>
